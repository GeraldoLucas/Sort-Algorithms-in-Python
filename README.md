# Sort-Algorithms-in-Python

###### I was studying some traditional algorithms and decided to create this repository

This repository is dedicated to 4 sorting algorithms: 
1. Selection Sort; 
2. 2. Bubble Sort; 
3. 3. Insertion Sort; 
4. 4. Merge Sort;

###### There is a Tests.py test file where the efficiency of the 4 algorithms are compared in different situations
